# C23-TR02_Talent-Recommender-System
This is our project for a talent recommendation system for the newsroom, Pukul Enam. Our team created a web-based recommendation system based on three parameters selected by the user. The first parameter is the role of talent in the newsroom: copywriting and design. The second parameter is the level of talent in the newsroom, both international and national. The last are the skills of talent in the news topic category: entertainment, finance, gaming, health, technology, and sport. The user will choose a range of values from 0 to 5 for each parameter. The values represent each talent's expertise on each parameter. The output will show three recommended talents. The project consists of a machine learning team working together to create a program to recommend talent and a cloud computing team to create an attractive and responsible web interface for publicly accessible users.
